# agevault

`agevault` is a directory encryption tool using [`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) file
encryption.

It locks/unlocks a vault (directory) with a passphrase-protected identity file.

Like `age`, it features no config options, allowing for a straightforward secure flow.

## Disclaimer

This project has been tested, but has not undergone a formal security audit, and none is planned.

The codebase is intentionally kept simple and readable, so you're encouraged to review it yourself
before relying on it for anything sensitive.

**Use at your own risk** (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)).

## Installation

Always install the latest release to make sure you have the latest security improvements and fixes.
If the update has the same major version (e.g. `v1.x.x`), then it's guaranteed to be backwards
compatible.

### Download the pre-built binaries

Get them from the [latest release](https://github.com/ndavd/agevault/releases/latest).

### Using `nix`

```text
$ nix run github:ndavd/agevault
```

### Using `go`

```text
$ go install github.com/ndavd/agevault@latest
```

### Using `docker`

```text
$ docker build -t agevault .
$ docker run --rm -it -u ${UID}:${GID} -v .:/tmp agevault
```

## Usage

```text
lock/unlock directory with passphrase-protected identity file
usage: agevault [directory-name] lock|unlock|keygen
```

Securing `my-vault/`:

1. Generate identity file

```text
$ agevault my-vault keygen
create identity passphrase: 
confirm identity passphrase: 
.age14tpkpl6vexufah8eq5dgrd5zy4xqs4slynh26j5n7gvxs87xhguqwu9zqc.my-vault.key.age CREATED (do not change the filename)
```

2. Lock vault

```text
$ agevault my-vault lock
my-vault LOCKED with age14tpkpl6vexufah8eq5dgrd5zy4xqs4slynh26j5n7gvxs87xhguqwu9zqc
```

3. Unlock vault

```text
$ agevault my-vault unlock
enter passphrase for identity file ".age14tpkpl6vexufah8eq5dgrd5zy4xqs4slynh26j5n7gvxs87xhguqwu9zqc.my-vault.key.age": 
my-vault UNLOCKED
```

4. That's it. Do your changes, lock it again, etc.

## Design

`agevault` relies entirely on `age` for the cryptography involved, inheriting its security. It
provides the minimal infrastructure required for `age` to work as a directory encryption tool.

`agevault` uses a passphrase encrypted identity for a few key reasons:

- Extra security factor: Having the encrypted identity file or the passphrase by itself is useless.
- Easier to lock: If only symmetric encryption was used, the user would need the passphrase to lock
  as well; this way, the vault can be locked without entering the passphrase.
- Ability to support multiple keys in the future ([planned features](#planned-features)): This makes
  it possible to support multiple passphrases, each corresponding to its own key, so multiple people
  could _own_ the vault: any one of them can lock it, and any one of them can unlock it with their
  own passphrase.

## Planned features

- Post-quantum keys
- Multi-user vault support
